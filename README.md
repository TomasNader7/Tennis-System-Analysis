# Tennis-System-Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes tennis matches using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It leverages YOLO for object detection, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification, and Python-based data processing to extract insights from match footage.

Features

Player Tracking: Detects and tracks players' movements using YOLO.

Ball Detection: Identifies the tennis ball in real-time.

Stroke Classification: Uses CNNs to classify different types of strokes.

Match Statistics: Extracts key performance metrics such as shot accuracy, player positioning, and rally duration.

Visualization: Generates annotated video outputs with detected objects and tracking paths.

Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for implementation.

YOLO (You Only Look Once): Object detection for player and ball tracking.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Stroke classification.

OpenCV: Video processing and computer vision operations.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning model training and inference.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
